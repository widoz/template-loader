# WordPress Template Loader

A simple hookable template loader for WordPress. Allow you to load templates in chain from child to plugin.

This is not for the WordPress templates in the form of "name-slug.php" with fallback to name.php.
Indeed this is a loader to build a basic data injection for views (templates).

## Requirements
Php >= 5.6.x
